Citizen Budget
=======================================

Most cities don't have an easy way to show their citizens the details of the city budget. Citizen Budget takes the information from the city financial documents and displays it in a easy to use webpage. Anyone can access the page from a browser without having to download PDF or spreadsheet documents.

There are two main pages on the website.

The Main Budget page shows the overall budget and the budget of each fund for a given year. Navigation to a specific fund page is made by clicking on a fund name. Different years can be selected by clicking on the historical graph.

The fund page show the amount budgeted and spent for each catagory in that fund. These numbers are also shown visually in a bar graph. This page is also where city officials can give explinations for specific line items with popup notes. They can also give explainations for the entire fund in the highlights section.

The easy to read graphs, tables, and accesiblity of the information on a webpage help citizens see the budget and become informed about how the city is using their tax dollars.
